# CS50 Diary
## Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
### Description:
The idea for this diary came from my need for a central/ common space for all the course mates to interact with each other whether they are pursuing online or on-site course, whether they are new or old to CS in general. Yes, we have ways to form study groups, but they do not meet my needs. What I wanted was something akin to how we can interact with anyone in the classroom chat and have an in-depth discussion on topics that interest us and at the same time it can also be a place where we share our troubles (not asking for a direct solutions).

**Main purpose of this diary is _sharing and interacting_** (Obviously not sharing answers to P-Set which will defeat the purpose of the course).  

To fulfil this goal, I decided to create a web-app which can be used to share our thoughts and troubles with others. 

<ins>This application is based on flask and will support User defined permissions</ins>:
+ A registered user 
    + Can view any posts
    + Can create, edit and delete there own posts
    + Can update username and email.
    + Can change password (Require a valid email, because a temporary link will be sent to the user for verification.)
+ A guest user
    + Can view any posts
    + Can register and become a registered user
    + Do not have access to do anything else
+ If clicked on username on the post, app will filter out all the posts related to that user.
